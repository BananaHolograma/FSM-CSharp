# A finite state machine designed to cover 95% of use cases, providing essential functionality and a basic state node that can be extended now in C#.

# There is nothing wrong using the same process on the CharacterBody2D to handle all the movement but when the things start to grow and the player can perform a wide number of moves it is better to start thinking about a modular way to build this movement. 
# In this case, a state machine is a design pattern widely employed in the video game industry to manage this complexity
